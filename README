The library makes use of OAuth. At the moment you can use either of these libraries:

    * PHP OAuth extension (http://pecl.php.net/package/oauth)
    * PEAR's HTTP_OAUTH package (http://pear.php.net/package/http_oauth)

You will need an consumer key/secret. I guess I'll manage to share mine once this extension is ready but I have to be sure it's OK to do so.
