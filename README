The library makes use of OAuth. At the moment you can use either of these libraries:

    * PHP OAuth extension (http://pecl.php.net/package/oauth)
    * PEAR's HTTP_OAUTH package (http://pear.php.net/package/http_oauth)

You will need an application key/secret which you may generate by registering an
application on https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps.
